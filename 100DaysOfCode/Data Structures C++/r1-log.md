# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Emrah Sariboz

I decided to log my progress on Day 18.

## Day 18
### 9/30/19

- ## Linked List
### What did I do: 
  I added new functions to the Linked List application. New functions are: Delete Node, insert Node to sorted Linked List, check whether LL sorted or not  
  and remove duplicates from the sorted Linked List  
## [Link To Work](https://github.com/emrahsariboz/Cpp-Projects/tree/master/Data%20Structures%20C%2B%2B/Linked%20List)

  
## Where I Left Off
  I left off working on getting an SVG timeline to render based on the times of the RC's.




## Day 19

### 10/1/19


- ## Reversing the Linked List
### What did I do: 
  Implemented three different version of "reversin the linked list" method. 
They are array based reversing, using two different pointer 
  and using recursion.

## [Link To Work](https://github.com/emrahsariboz/Cpp-Projects/tree/master/Data%20Structures%20C%2B%2B/Linked%20List)

  

## Where I Left Off
  I left off on a merge function. It is used to merge two linked list.




## Day 20

### 10/2/19


- ## Mergin Linked List
### What did I do: 
  Implemented the merge operation on two sorted Linked List. Also, figured out how to detect loop in Linked List using two points.

## [Link To Work](https://github.com/emrahsariboz/Cpp-Projects/tree/master/Data%20Structures%20C%2B%2B/Linked%20List)

  

## Where I Left Off
  Tomorrow, I am going to write all the function from beginning. Will create clean Linked List class before I move to Circular Linked List.
  
  
## Day 21

### 10/3/19


- ## Singly Linked List
### What did I do: 
  Implemented Singly Linked List class from scratch. Added "insertion", "deletion", "count", "display" , "reverse using two pointer" and "reverse using recursion" functions.

## [Link To Work](https://github.com/emrahsariboz/Cpp-Projects/tree/master/100DaysOfCode/Data%20Structures%20C%2B%2B/LinkedList%20Complete%20Class)

  

## Where I Left Off
  Tomorrow, I am going to start circular linked list.



## Day 22

### 10/3/19


- ## Singly Circular Linked List
### What did I do: 
  Implemented Singly Circular Linked List class from scratch. Added "create", "insert", "delete", "and display" functions. 

## [Link To Work](https://github.com/emrahsariboz/Cpp-Projects/tree/master/100DaysOfCode/Data%20Structures%20C%2B%2B/Circular%20Singly%20Linked%20List)

  

## Where I Left Off
  Tomorrow, I am going to start doubly linked list.
  
  
## Day 23

### 10/4/19


- ## Doubly Linked List Class
### What did I do: 
  Implemented Doubly  Linked List class from scratch. Added "create", "insert", "delete", "reverse", "and display" functions. 

## [Link To Work](https://github.com/emrahsariboz/Cpp-Projects/tree/master/100DaysOfCode/Data%20Structures%20C%2B%2B/Doubly%20Linked%20List)

  

## Where I Left Off
  I will complete Linked List structure with the implementation circular doubly linked list structure tomorrow.
  
  
### 10/5/19


- ## Circular Doubly Linked List Class
### What did I do: 
  Implemented Circular Doubly  Linked List class from scratch. Added "create", "insert", "count", "search" "and display" functions.
  Delete and Reverse functionalities will be addded tomorrow. I will be done with Linked List in couple of days. I just want to make
  sure I am fluent in it before I move to next data structures.

## [Link To Work](https://github.com/emrahsariboz/Cpp-Projects/tree/master/100DaysOfCode/Data%20Structures%20C%2B%2B/Circular%20Doubly%20LinkedList)

  

## Where I Left Off
  I will add more functionalities to Circular Doubly Linked List tomorrow.
  
### 10/6/19


- ## Circular Doubly Linked List Class
### What did I do: 
  I stuck at delete operation. My code has weird bug that I need to fix it. 
  

## Where I Left Off
  I will continue work on this class before I move to next topic.
