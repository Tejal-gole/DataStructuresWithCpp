# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Emrah Sariboz
## Day 18
### 9/30/19

- ## Linked List
### What did I do: 
  I added new functions to the Linked List application. New functions are: Delete Node, insert Node to sorted Linked List, check whether LL sorted or not  
## and remove duplicates from the sorted Linked List  
## [Link To Work](https://github.com/emrahsariboz/Cpp-Projects/tree/master/Data%20Structures%20C%2B%2B/Linked%20List)

  
## Where I Left Off
  I left off working on getting an SVG timeline to render based on the times of the RC's.




## Day 19

### 10/1/19


- ## Reversing the Linked List
### What did I do: 
  Implemented three different version of "reversin the linked list" method. 
They are array based reversing, using two different pointer 
  and using recursion.

## [Link To Work](https://github.com/emrahsariboz/Cpp-Projects/tree/master/Data%20Structures%20C%2B%2B/Linked%20List)

  

## Where I Left Off
  I left off on a merge function. It is used to merge two linked list.




## Day 20

### 10/2/19


- ## Mergin Linked List
### What did I do: 
  Implemented the merge operation on two sorted Linked List. Also, figured out how to detect loop in Linked List using two points.

## Where I Left Off
  Tomorrow, I am going to write all the function from beginning. Will create clean Linked List class before I move to Circular Linked List.
  
  
## Day 21

### 10/3/19


- ## Mergin Linked List
### What did I do: 
  Implemented Singly Linked List class from scratch. Added "insertion", "deletion", "count", "display" , "reverse using two pointer" and "reverse using recursion" functions.

## [Link To Work](https://github.com/emrahsariboz/Cpp-Projects/tree/master/Data%20Structures%20C%2B%2B/Linked%20List)

  

## Where I Left Off
  Tomorrow, I am going to start circular linked list.
