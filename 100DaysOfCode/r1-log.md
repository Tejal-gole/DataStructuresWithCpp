## Day 34
### 10/15/19


- ## Queue Implementation
### What did I do: 
  I got confused on the implementation of the queue. First, I though he didn't implement FIFO structre. So, I went and code others implementation.
  When I go back to binary tree, I saw that he used old code from previous videos. I went back to that implmentatio and figured its not wrong.
  Now, I have completely working circular queue which is ready to apply binary tree.
